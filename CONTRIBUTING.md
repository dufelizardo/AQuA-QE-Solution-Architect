# Contributing Guide

Thanks for considering contributing to **AQuA-QE Solution Architect**! Before anything else, it's worth reading `WHITEPAPER.en.md` (or `WHITEPAPER.md` in Portuguese) and `docs/agent/` to understand what the agent does and why.

## Reporting issues

- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/dufelizardo/AQuA-QE-Solution-Architect/issues) before opening a new one.
- If it looks like a known gap, check the [Backlog project](https://github.com/users/dufelizardo/projects/5) first — it already has 8 issues cataloging what was deliberately deferred (C4 diagrams, API contracts, UML/BPMN/Swagger parsers, additional pattern categories, real write integrations, RAG/memory, among others).
- When reporting a bug, include: steps to reproduce, expected vs. observed behavior, the input source used (`--arquivo`/`--texto`/`--jira`/`--confluence`), and the active LLM provider (`LLM_PROVIDER`, if different from the `ollama` default).

## Proposing changes (Pull Requests)

- For a large change, open an issue first describing what you intend to do.
- Prefer small, focused PRs — avoid mixing a bug fix with a new feature.
- **This repository has no lint/type-check config of its own** (`ruff`/`basedpyright` only exist at the root of the monorepo this project originated from) — there's nothing to run here.
- Run `uv sync` then `uv run pytest` before opening the PR. The entire suite is mocked — no test makes a real call to Ollama/Jira/Confluence; a PR that needs real network access to pass a test will not be accepted.
- Any change to a generator/reviewer skill must preserve the `generate → validate (Python checklist) → review (second, independent LLM) → [refine, human-in-the-loop] → explicit human acceptance` cycle. No skill or workflow may set `ArtifactStatus.ACCEPTED` on its own — that's always a human act in `run.py`.
- Changes that let a skill invent data outside the input source, or bypass human review, are rejected. This agent's most critical guardrail is **GR-SA-1** (`identify_architecture_pattern` can only choose a pattern from the closed catalog in `knowledge/methodology/architecture_patterns.md` — never an invented pattern, even if the LLM tries) — see `docs/agent/guardrails.md` for the full set (GR-SA-1 through GR-SA-7).
- If the change affects observable behavior, also update the relevant docs: `docs/agent/*`, `README.md`/`README.pt.md`, `WHITEPAPER.md`/`WHITEPAPER.en.md`, and the diagrams in `docs/architecture/` (draw.io + SVG) if the flow changed.

## Development environment

```bash
# Python 3.12+ and uv already installed
ollama pull mistral   # generation
ollama pull phi4      # independent reviewer

uv sync
cp .env.example .env  # fill in if using --jira/--confluence

uv run pytest
```

## Pull Request process

1. Fork the repository, branch from `main`.
2. Make the change, with tests covering the new behavior.
3. `uv run pytest` locally before opening the PR.
4. Describe the change in the PR, referencing the related issue (e.g. "Closes #12").
5. Wait for review — be open to adjustments, especially around the guardrails.
